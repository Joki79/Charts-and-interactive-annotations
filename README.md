# [Project 1: Charts-and-interactive-annotations](https://github.com/Joki79/Interactive-anottations-and-IQR)


Comparing bars to a range using tricolor palette and interactive annotations


Using matplotlib to apply interactive annotations to the base visualization in order to understand uncertain data better


This project is a part of my work done for the Coursera Data Science specialization by University of Michigan. We were asked to recreate the visual presented in the paper Ferreira et al, 2014.

I implemented the bar coloring where the color of the bar is actually based on the amount of data covered. I added the interactivity button that allows user to interactively set a range of y values they are interested in, and recolor based on this

     

# [Project 2a): Cairo-s-principles-of-visualization  Number of hailstorms in Denver, Collin and Laramie over the past 30 years](https://github.com/Joki79/Cairo-s-principles-of-visualization)
Number of hailstorms in Denver, Collin and Laramie over the past 30 years

This project is a part of my work done for the Coursera Data Science specialization by University of Michigan. 

We were given the overall assignemnet instructions  but the research question and the data source are my ideas.

Denver, Collin or Laramie? Which county has had the most hailstorms over the past 30 years ?

This visual is supposed to attract readers attention by displaying two apparently 'contradictory' graphs. The final purpose of the visual is to help reader to answer the research question: 'Which county had the most hailstorms over the past 30 years?' and to illustrate how graphics can lie.

# [Project 3: Machine learning Detroit blight model](https://github.com/Joki79/My-Data-Science-portfolio/blob/main/Detroit%20blight%20model.ipynb)

For this project I built a classifier for the actual data from the City of Detroit. The model predicts the  blight ticket compliance and can serve the city to increase same.

I did a lot of data analyzing, cleaning, some encoding and clustering. After few trials, I chose the Decision tree calssifier and tuned some parameters. The AUROC score for the test data was over 0.75.

# Project 4: World happiness report
# [PART I](https://github.com/Joki79/My-DS-projects/blob/main/Happiness%20score%20Part%20I%20-Data%20preprocessing%20.ipynb) 
# [PART II](https://github.com/Joki79/My-DS-projects/blob/main/Happiness%20score-PART%20II-%20Plotly%2C%20matplotlib%2C%20seaborn%20and%20analysis.ipynb) 
# [PART III](https://github.com/Joki79/My-DS-projects/blob/main/Happiness%20score%20-%20Part%20III%20-Data%20analysis%20and%20modelling.ipynb)

In this project I have analyzed the data on happiness index. In the part 1 I have cleaned my data and kept only countries that had data for entire period 2015-2019.
In the part 2 I focused on visualizing data and the data distribution. I have used geoplots, histograms, Q-Q plots for testing data normality and box and whisker plots to get the better insight into data. 
The part 3 was focused on data analysis and the development of the potential model. There were couple of limitations. The data collected was over 4 years and it is hard to talk off a trend. However I analyzed the existing data and the features over those 4 years in order to determine which feature was affecting the happiness index the most and which feature was becoming more important. 
Another limitation waas the fact that the happiness index is actually the sum of all  feature values. Therefore the linear regression with all featutres was not an appropriate choice of model. Instead I have used only the most importan features for my model and achieved the r^2 score of 64%.
