# [Project 1: Charts-and-interactive-annotations](https://github.com/Joki79/Interactive-anottations-and-IQR)


Comparing bars to a range using tricolor palette and interactive annotations


Using matplotlib to apply interactive annotations to the base visualization in order to understand uncertain data better


This project is a part of my work done for the Coursera Data Science specialization by University of Michigan. We were asked to recreate the visual presented in the paper Ferreira et al, 2014.

I implemented the bar coloring where the color of the bar is actually based on the amount of data covered. I added the interactivity button that allows user to interactively set a range of y values they are interested in, and recolor based on this

     

# [Project 2a): Cairo-s-principles-of-visualization  Number of hailstorms in Denver, Collin and Laramie over the past 30 years](https://github.com/Joki79/Cairo-s-principles-of-visualization)
Number of hailstorms in Denver, Collin and Laramie over the past 30 years

This project is a part of my work done for the Coursera Data Science specialization by University of Michigan. 

We were given the overall assignemnet instructions  but the research question and the data source are my ideas.

Denver, Collin or Laramie? Which county has had the most hailstorms over the past 30 years ?

This visual is supposed to attract readers attention by displaying two apparently 'contradictory' graphs. The final purpose of the visual is to help reader to answer the research question: 'Which county had the most hailstorms over the past 30 years?' and to illustrate how graphics can lie.
